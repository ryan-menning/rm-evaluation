## Project objective:
### Explore and predict, if possible, the best combination of ingredients and equipment parameters for the manufacture of inorganic colored pigments to produce within customer specifications .

<br/>

### Brief explanation of "color numbers"
"Color numbers" is a generic term for what is specifically known as "Lab" or CIELab values. Essentially, CIELab values are a way to plot colors on a 3-dimensional plane.  The "L" value represents a position on the vertical axis, the "a" value represents a position on a horizontal axis and the "b" value represents a position on another horizontal axis that is perpendicular to the "a" axis. 
For more information on CIELab values you can check out this short [article](https://www.xrite.com/blog/lab-color-space).

- github repo
- Read in Excel files
- Clean and join tables
- Explore data through visualizations
### Still to do
- Create supervised learning model
- Evaluate model
- Create visualizations



## How the project meets the Feature List requirements
### Feature 1:
- [x] Read in Excel files

### Feature 2:
- [x] Join/Merge files with pandas

### Feature 3: 
- [x] Matplotlib/seaborn visualizations

The project utilizes a jupyter notebook to step through code blocks. There is one code block that expects user input so choosing 'Run All' will stop execution at that cell until the appropriate user input is entered.
